Similarly to the definition of the distance of closest approach (DCA) for two arbitrary ellipses[^1] 
we define the DCA for an arbitrary ellipse and a line segment.

The quantity we are looking for is \\(l\\) with:

$$l = \parallel \vec{OP} \parallel − r − d$$

\\(P\\) is the nearest point on \\([AB]\\) to the ellipse. 
Knowing \\(\alpha\\) we can easily calculate \\(r\\). To solve the above mentioned equation  
one has to find the quantity \\(d\\), which would be the necessary
amount to translate \\([AB]\\) along the direction of \\(OP\\) such that it becomes tangential to the ellipse. 

We have:

$$x_R^' = x_R −d·\cos(\alpha)\;\; \rm{and}\;\; y_R^' = y_R −d·sin(\alpha).$$

The parametric definition of the line segment \\([AB]\\) is:


$$x_R = x_A +u\cdot(x_B −x_A)\;\; \rm{and}\;\; y_R = y_A + u\cdot(y_B −y_A); u \in [0, 1].$$


\\(x_R^'\)) is on the ellipse, which implies 

$$\frac{(x_R − d \cdot cos(\alpha))^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y_R − d \cdot sin(\alpha))^2}{b^2} = 1.$$
