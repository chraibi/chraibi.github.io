I am a post-doc at <a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de">Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich</a>.
My research topic is pedestrian dynamics, focusing on the development of mathematical models 
to describe the motion of pedestrians.

In November 2008, I completed my studies at <a href="http://www.tu-harburg.de/">Hamburg University of Technology</a>. 
The subject of my <a href="http://juwel.fz-juelich.de:8080/dspace/handle/2128/3663">Diploma Thesis</a> was titled: 
"Ordinary Differential Equations to Describe Pedestrian Dynamics" (German).  

In my <a href="http://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/21705">PhD thesis</a> (May 2012 at the institute of theoretical physics in Cologne University) I investigated validated force-based models for pedestrian dynamics.

Teaching
=====

At the department <a href="http://www.asim.uni-wuppertal.de/en.html">Computer Simulation for Fire Safety and 
Pedestrian Traffic</a> in the University of Wuppertal 
I have some educational activities. Besides, supervising PhD/master/bachelor students I give the following lectures:


- "Informatics for engineers" (Summer)
- "Pedestrian Dynamics" (Winter)
