<p>I am a post-doc at <a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de">Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich</a>. My research topic is pedestrian dynamics, focusing on the development of mathematical models to describe the motion of pedestrians.</p>
<p>In November 2008, I completed my studies at <a href="http://www.tu-harburg.de/">Hamburg University of Technology</a>. The subject of my <a href="http://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/5145">Diploma Thesis</a> was titled: &quot;Ordinary Differential Equations to Describe Pedestrian Dynamics&quot; (German).</p>
<p>In my <a href="http://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/21705">PhD thesis</a> (May 2012 at the institute of theoretical physics in Cologne University) I investigated validated force-based models for pedestrian dynamics.</p>

<p>At the department <a href="http://www.asim.uni-wuppertal.de/en.html">Computer Simulation for Fire Safety and Pedestrian Traffic</a> in the University of Wuppertal I have some educational activities. Besides, supervising PhD/master/bachelor students I give the following lectures:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Informatics for engineers&quot; (Summer)</li>
<li>&quot;Pedestrian Dynamics&quot; (Winter)</li>
</ul>
