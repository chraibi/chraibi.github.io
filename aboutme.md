## About me
Researcher, Emacs-enthusiast, procrastinator and more.

## Research profile 

### Topics:

- Modeling of pedestrian dynamics
- Validation and verification of models for pedestrian dynamics
- Fundamental diagram (density-velocity relation and density-flow relation)
- Research Software Development

### Methods:

- Space-continuous force-based models
- Space-continuous velocity-based models
- Cellular-automata for pedestrian dynamics
- Data-based models for pedestrian dynamics (NN, deep-learning, â€¦)
- Development of tools and scripts for data analysis

## My story
What else do you need to know?

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro) and it will answer **all** your questions.
