  "body": "### About\r\nI am a post-doc at [Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich](http://www.fz-juelich.de).\r\nMy research topic is pedestrian dynamics, focusing on the development of mathematical models to describe the motion of pedestrians.\r\n\r\nIn November 2008 I completed my studies at [Hamburg University of Technology](http://www.tu-harburg.de/). The subject of my [Diploma Thesis](http://juwel.fz-juelich.de:8080/dspace/handle/2128/3663) was titled: \"Ordinary Differential Equations to Describe Pedestrian Dynamics\" (German).  In my [PhD thesis](http://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/21705) (May 2012 at the institute of theoretical physics in Cologne University) I investigated validated force-based models for pedestrian dynamics. \r\n\r\n### Teaching\r\nAt the department [Computer Simulation for Fire Safety and Pedestrian Traffic](http://www.asim.uni-wuppertal.de/en.html) in the University of Wuppertal I have some educational activities. Besides, supervising PhD/master/bachelor students I give the following lectures:\r\n \r\n- \"Informatics for engineers\" (Summer)\r\n- \"Pedestrian Dynamics\" (Winter)\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n[Here](http://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/Research/ModellingSimulation/CivilSecurityTaraffic/Projects/_node.html) is \r\na collection of projects, where I contributed to in one way or another. \r\n\r\nActually, my main focus lays in the development of [JuPedSim](http://jupedsim.github.io/jpscore/); a framework to model, simulate and analyze pedestrian dynamics.  \r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\nAn updated list of my publications can be found [here](http://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/AboutUs/Staff/personalItems/chraibi_m-publications.html?nn=362224)\r\n\r\n",
